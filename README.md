Egyptian Rat Screw: 
We will be designed a two-person version of Egyptian Rat Screw. The user is player 1 and the computer is player 2. 
Each player begins with half of the card deck. The players switch back and forth between flipping a card from 
their deck into the center pile. When a certain card or pattern of cards is at the top of the center pile, 
the players are expected to slap the center card pile. The player who slaps the center pile correctly 
gets to keep the cards in the pile. The center pile is empty again, and the players continue to switch back and 
forth flipping cards. This gameplay continues until one player gets all of the cards. 

How to get the code running: 
1. Download the repository from git. 
Version 1 - Jacks and Doubles 
2. Once you have the workspace set up, go to the main.m file and run the program. Another option is call on main.m in the command line. 
Version 2 - Jacks, Doubles, Add to ten, Sandwich, Marriage, Triple Suit 
3. Click on the version 2 folder within matlab
4. Open up the main_v2.m file and run the program. Another option is call on main_v2.m in the command line.
