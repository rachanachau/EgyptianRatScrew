**Egyptian Rat Screw:** 

We designed a two-person version of Egyptian Rat Screw. The user is player 1 and the computer is player 2. 
Each player begins with half of the card deck. The players switch back and forth between flipping a card from 
their deck into the center pile. When a certain card or pattern of cards is at the top of the center pile, 
the players are expected to slap the center card pile. The player who slaps the center pile correctly 
gets to keep the cards in the pile. The center pile is empty again, and the players continue to switch back and 
forth flipping cards. This gameplay continues until one player gets all of the cards. 

**How to get the code running:** 
- Download the repository from git. 

*Version 1 - Jacks and Doubles* 

- Once you have the workspace set up, go to the prompt.m file and run the program. Another option is call on prompt.m in the command line. 

*Version 2 - Jacks, Doubles, Add to Ten, Sandwich, Marriage, Triple Suit* 

- Click on the version 2 folder within MATLAB.
- Open up the prompt_v2.m file and run the program. Another option is call on prompt_v2.m in the command line.

**How to play:**
1. Once you run prompt.m or prompt_v2.m, read the instructions and follow the commands on the screen.
2. When it is your turn, press "f" to flip a card or "s" to slap a card. You want to slap when a certain card or pattern of cards is at the top of the center pile (e.g. a Jack).
3. When you perform a valid slap, you get all of the center pile cards.
4. Whoever runs out of cards first loses the game.

Have fun!

**Additional Notes:**

We each spent approximately 4-5 hours updating the code and testing in addition to the hours we outlined in the project. We had some trouble getting the board to properly show up after adding different features, so we had to make small changes. We also all took the initiative to get friends to play the game and provide feedback. Using this feedback, we improved the speed at which the player could flip and slap the card. People were pressing the bottom too fast and they could see our code. We also got comments that the text was too small, so we made it larger. Also we had to make sure we were appending to the front of the list in all our code, because it was just looping through the cards in the middle. As a result, people had trouble winning the game sometimes. 

Moreover, we encourage you to play all the different scenarios of game (winning, losing, and tie) so you can see the different animations at the end!
